# Fancy

### introduce
I'm a beginner to a front-end engineer, and this inventory is my first work -- a website that is divided into three sibling pages:
***
##### 1. Fancy search page
This search page I plan to build an aggregate search page with its own search engine. Unfortunately, now I can only build a search page with Baidu search box. It is extremely important that flashy search pages still have a lot of problems with responsiveness and are not very satisfactory on the mobile side.

##### 2. My personal blog
The functionality of personal blogs is not much to say. In terms of visual rendering, this page still uses responsive (more complete), when the computer browsing will be divided into two modules of the left and right ratio of 3:1, in the mobile phone side will be rendered in the form above.

##### 3. Favorites page
This page will store the websites I frequent in a classified form. Unfortunately, this page does not currently support modifying the content of the page directly on the user side, that is, if I want to add a new site portal to this page, I have to make changes in the background of the site.
***
About the future:
1. Improve the flashy search engine and improve the responsiveness of the flashy page
2. Stick to your personal blog and keep track of growth
3. Join the website account login function
4. Allow favorite page users to personalize changes and log in to different accounts to keep those changes in the cloud
5. Continuously optimize the UI interface at different ends
***
Obviously, the site is very imperfect, the main reason is limited by the ability of the producer himself.
As a beginner, I wish I could keep learning, constantly filling myself in, and then improve/optimize the site with more professional knowledge.
Hopefully one day, I can make a well-known work.
